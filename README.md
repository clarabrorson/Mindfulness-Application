# Mindful Coding

## Description

This project serves as my thesis work, combining frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with cloud services such as Azure to create a web application focused on mindfulness for developers. The purpose of this project is not only to master frontend technologies but also to explore how they can be integrated with cloud services. Mindful Coding is designed to enhance well-being and reduce stress among developers during coding sessions and in their overall work environment.

## Features

- Breathing Circle Animation: Guided breathing exercises synchronized with visual cues to facilitate relaxation and improve focus during coding sessions.

- Modal, Menu, and Audio Control: Seamless access to meditation sessions, background music control, and menu options for a user-friendly experience.

- Background Selection: Customizable meditation environment with a selection of background images, including forest, sky, and ocean themes.

- API Quotes Functionality: Inspirational Zen quotes fetched from an API and displayed in a modal to motivate and inspire coders during breaks.

- Stretching & Yoga: Access stretching and yoga exercises specifically designed for desk workers. Learn techniques for relieving tension, improving posture, and enhancing overall well-being during long coding sessions.
